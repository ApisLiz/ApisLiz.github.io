# open PhD positions
I am currently looking to recruit up to 4 new PhD students to work on core computer systems research. Positions are fully funded, primarily via research assistantship. Send me an email to learn more about this opportunity. 

# research interests 
While my interests have varied over the years, I am currently focusing on core computer systems research, including operating systems, concurrency, performance, and operating systems. 

# teaching 
I teach and have had a hand in the design of many of the systems classes in the CS department, such as 
  - CS361: Computer Systems Programming
  - CS450: Computer Networks
  - CS461: Operating System Design and Implementation
  - CS463: Systems Performance and Concurrent Computing

I see teaching as the most important part of my job, and thus I spend a great deal of time and effort on my classes. In return, I get overall high marks on [RateMyProfessors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1233589) and have received, among other teaching awards, the [UIC Award for Excellence in Teaching](https://faculty.uic.edu/awards/recognition/aet/aet-recipients/) in 2022.
